A Demo Game I've created for [Ludum Dare 38](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38) where the theme was 'A Small World'. 

The basic Idea is, instead of standard Rubic's Cube, how about if we slice the world into pieces and the game is to solve the world by solving this rubic's Sphere/World before the tiime runs out.
